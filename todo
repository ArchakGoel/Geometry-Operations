Code specific:

0. `Always look for best possible C++ and scientific coding practices aimed at readability, clean coding, accuracy and conciseness.`

    1. Check what type of functions should go in line in header and what not. For example, point const'r.
    2. Coding style guide - const'r input names differ from class names? Is that even neede?
    3. Split the code into .h and .cpp
    4. Define epsilon for linear and angular for comparisons.
    5. Method of getting angle betweeen vectors.
    6. Fix json or start with cmake.
    7. ##Remove #ifdef and replace with #pragma once.##

    Vector Class:
    1. {} operator - not needed. Works for vector3D{}
    2. = operator
    3. Remove << from friend.
    4. Advantage of Template over keeping just double, and possibly overload with float.

    Line Class:

    5. Check line definition: 2 pts or 1 pt and direction.
    6. Define edge, for 2 points.
