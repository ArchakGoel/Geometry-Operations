# Naming Convention

1. All data member, function, namespace names start with small letter, following camel case.
2. Class names and file names start with capital letter.
3. #pragma once instead of #ifndef
4. Avoid short names like `vec` or `calc` as much as possible. Full names only.
5. Function names should signify the action is it doing: calculateSomething().
