Keep methods non-member non-friend as much as possible for encapsulation.
Supporter methods keep them standalone, grouped in namespaces under separate header files based on sub-grouping.
Use smart pointers. Check customer deleters for arrays and such. Declare and initialize in separate line without clubbing with other functions.
