cleaning vs code caches if needed after refactoring:
    Cmd+shift+P --> 1.1. Reset IntelliSense Database 
                    1.2. Reload 
                    
For a new and possibly even little contrived code, write
it all in a .h file directly without worrying about splitting
classes in different files. That can be done later.
